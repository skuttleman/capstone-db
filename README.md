# The Legend of Tilde
## (db migration repo)

This is the db repo for my final project at Galvanize. It's sole purpose is to house migrations (and seeds if needed) for the SQL portion of my data store. For more on this project's development see the [front-end repo](https://www.github.com/skuttleman/capstone-front-end) and the [server repo](https://www.github.com/skuttleman/capstone-server)

This is a 2 player cooperative puzzle game. Players must communicate what they see and what they need from the other player through rudimentary symbols in order to solve the puzzles. It uses socket.io for game update notification when the player is online, or the Twilio API for SMS notification when the player is offline.
